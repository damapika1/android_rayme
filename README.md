# Squads 

#### A simple android project for DevOps (HoGent)

#### To avoid flakiness, we highly recommend that you turn off system animations on the virtual or physical devices used for testing. On your device, under Settings > Developer options, disable the following 3 settings:
#### Window animation scale Transition animation scale Animator duration scale

### Build With üèóÔ∏è
- [Kotlin] - Programming language for Android
- [Hilt-Dagger] - Standard library to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [Retrofit] -  A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Room] - SQLite object mapping library.
- [LiveData] - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
- [ViewModel] - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
- [ViewBinding] - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Jetpack Navigation] - Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app
- [Picasso] - An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling
- [Espresso] - Use Espresso to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.
- [Timber] - This is a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
- [Material] - Material Components for Android (MDC-Android) help developers execute Material Design.

### Project Architecture üóº

This app uses [MVVM (Model View View-Model)] architecture.

#### The app has following packages:
1. **model**: business logic and data: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. **di**: Dependency providing classes using Dagger.
3. **view**: presentation: View classes.
4. **viewmodel**: presentation logic: ViewModels to store and manage the data so it is ready to be presented.
5. **utils**: Utility classes.

### Testing creditentials:
1. **username**: user@mail.com
2. **password**: password
